# User Profile

Hey Stearns (or Astrik dev team)! Since you gave me more time to finish this project, I decided to add a bit more stuff than you asked.

As you can see I've change the project to a NextJS application, since Stearns said Next was great and I wanted to add a small mock of a backend I thought it was the best idea.

So, last start?

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the user profile.

If you would want to see more profiles, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run addUsers
# or
yarn addUsers
# or
pnpm addUsers
```

Go to the diretory `src/database/users.json`, pick a new id and place it on the url, and done, **NEW PROFILES!**

Anothe thing you can do it's run test! to do that just run the test command like this:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
```

And if you want to see the coverage of this project, just run this command and see the `index.html` on the directory `coverage/Icov-report/index.html`:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
# or
yarn test:coverage
# or
pnpm test:coverage
```
